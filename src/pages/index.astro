            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
            current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
            got every penny&acute;s worth.

            “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I&acute;
            ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who
            had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
            course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
            life. Since completing the course, I&acute; ve successfully switched
            careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”
